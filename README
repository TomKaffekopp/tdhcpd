TDHCPD - A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server

This software is result of experimenting with setting up my own home router.
I wanted to write my own key software that runs on it and this is one of them.

TDHCPD was written to run on Linux, but I believe it should be a small effort
to port it to other systems.

There are currently no pre-built packages for Your Favourite Linux Distro.
However, this software was written without any dependencies besides C++20.
That should make it simple to build and easy to install.

COMPILING

I have tested building with GCC 13.3.1 and Clang 17.0.6 on Gentoo.
CMake version 3.28 or greater is needed.

Inside the source folder, create a folder called "build".
Run "cmake" without any particular options from the build folder (ie. cmake ..)
Finally run "make" and you should have a binary called "tdhcpd".

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make -j8


INSTALLING

1. Move "tdhcpd" binary to for example /usr/local/sbin/tdhcpd.

2. Copy the example configuration tdhcpd.conf to /etc/tdhcpd.conf.

3. Create folder /var/tdhcpd - Here a persistent lease file will be saved.
   This is however configurable, under /etc/tdhcpd.conf.

4. Set up a service script to launch tdhcpd on boot (you're on your own here.)
   If you run OpenRC as init system, (f.ex. Gentoo) under the folder "openrc"
   in the source code you will find a service script for OpenRC.


CONFIGURING

Edit /etc/tdhcpd.conf and make it fit your network configuration.
If you don't have any preference, you only need to adjust the "interface" name.
